# Interactive card details form

![Design preview for the Interactive card details form coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## About the project

This is a challenge from the FrontEnd Challenge website (https://www.frontendmentor.io/home).

The objective is to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to: 

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Expected behaviour

- Update the details on the card as the user fills in the fields
- Validate the form fields when the form is submitted
- If there are no errors, display the completed state
- Reset the form when the user clicks "Continue" on the completed state

To do this challenge, I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
